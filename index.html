This is an issue that has caused the very unchanging player count.</p><h3>Landmines</h3><h2>Community and Discord Guild Issues</h2><h3>Lack of Well Written Rules</h3><p>The Suroi.io Discord guild only has <strong>five unclear rules</strong>. While it is understandable that writing a code of conduct for the community is difficult and tedious, most large open source projects just use a <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/">template</a> that is concise, accessible and simple to enforce as expectations are clear to everyone.</p><h3>Double Standards for Moderators and Community Members</h3><p>With the ambiguous rules set in place for the community, there are clear double standards between the moderators of the guild and its regular members. Some moderators are extremely toxic to the members of the community.</p><h2>Closing Thoughts</h2><ul><li>We know this will be censored by the moderation team by configuring Discord Automod.</li><li><strong>This is not a letter of harassment</strong>. We do not tolerate the harassment of the people mentioned and criticized in this letter, and the people who signed this letter.</li><li>The intended purpose of this letter is to raise awareness of issues in the Suroi.io community.</li><li>This letter will most likely be either bashed on or ignored by the owners of the game.</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Signed by:</strong></p><p><em>If you want your name on this list, make an issue or a pull request at the <a href="https://github.com/kenos1/save-suroi-together">Github</a>.</em></p><ul><li>Bienstar</li><li>Kenos</li><li>2 anonymous signers</li></ul></article><script src="./client.js"></script></body></html>
